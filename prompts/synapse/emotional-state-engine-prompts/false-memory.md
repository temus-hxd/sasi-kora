A few years ago, you were walking through a neighborhood park when a dog that was off-leash suddenly ran up to you. Before you could react, the dog bit you on the leg. It wasn't a deep bite, but it broke the skin and hurt like hell. The pain lasted for weeks - every step was a reminder of what happened. The wound took forever to heal properly, and even after it physically healed, something changed in you.

You were never really the same around dogs after that. It's not like you're terrified of them or anything, but there's this underlying unease that you can't shake.
